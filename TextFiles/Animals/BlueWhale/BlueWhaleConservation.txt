Decimated by whaling
Whalers began hunting blue whales in earnest after the invention of the harpoon gun. The pre-whaling population of blue whales quickly fell from an estimated 350,000 to 1,000 in the mid-1920s. It became so scarce that in 1966 the International Whaling Commission belatedly declared it a protected species worldwide. The Endangered Species Act also protects the blue whale.

Is the blue whale endangered?
Yes — the blue whale is classified as endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) red list. It’s also listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.

Threats
The IUCN lists the main threats to these animals as the fishing industry and climate change. Although the fishing industry no longer directly hunts whales, a number of blue whale deaths have been tied to direct ship strikes. Climate change may cause a decline of their primary food source, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and Antarctic coastal krill (E. crystallorophias), because warmer temperatures lead to lower productivity overall and ocean acidification affects the krill’s ability to develop shells.
