The blue whale has a nickname totally unrelated to its size. In Arctic or Antarctic waters, yellow diatoms (microscopic algae) often stick to the blue whale’s underbody, giving it the nickname "sulfur bottom."
Nursing calves can gain up to 200 pounds (90 kg) of body weight a day.
A blue whale sleeps while swimming, although it’s never fully unconscious — that could result in drowning. Instead, the blue whale lightly naps as it slowly swims along the surface of the water.
