Climate change affects deep-sea animals. As the ocean warms, scientists are observing an increased number of low-oxygen “dead zones”. The deep oxygen-minimum layer (the part of the deep sea where the vampire squid lives) is also expanding. Scientists study how animals like the vampire squid survive in the oxygen-minimum layer. They compare these species with species that live outside this habitat to better understand the changing ocean.
