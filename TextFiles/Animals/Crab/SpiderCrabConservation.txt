Over the past 40 years, the catch of Japanese spider crabs has declined. To help the population recover, Japanese law bans fishing for this species during its mating season. 

Rising ocean temperatures due to climate change may negatively impact this species by reducing the number of larvae that survive to become adults and by degrading seaweed beds that could reduce the amount of food that falls to the seafloor where the crabs live.
