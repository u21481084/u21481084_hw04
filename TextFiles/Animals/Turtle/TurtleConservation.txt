All geographical groups of green turtles are listed as either endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Some populations are doing better than others. The populations in Hawaii and Costa Rica, for example, have been on the rise for decades thanks to effective conservation work. But in the south and west Pacific, populations face many threats and are endangered — primarily due to climate change, fishing, egg harvesting, nest destruction and other human activity.

In fact, all green turtles are of conservation concern — rated vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered by the IUCN. While some populations have seen some improvement, no green turtle populations have improved enough to be removed from the list of endangered species. Most sea turtle populations are in decline.
