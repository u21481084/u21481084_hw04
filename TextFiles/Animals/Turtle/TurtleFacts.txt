The green turtle is the largest species of hard-shelled turtles, and is the second largest of all sea turtles.
Green turtles are thought to live for 60 to 70 years, reaching sexual maturity at 25 to 35 years old.
Female green turtles return to the same beach where they were born to nest, no matter how far it is.
